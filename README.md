  # A basic start to a MERN project
  
  ## Description
  
  This basic code using the MERN technologies, JWT, and vite to start a new project. It has the back and front end needed for account creation and loggin in. I'm just using basic bootstrap to create what little front end there is

  you just need to include your own .env files with something like this in it: 
  
  ` SECRET=mern-basics`

  `EXPIRATION = 2h `
